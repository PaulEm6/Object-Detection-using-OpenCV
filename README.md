# Object Detection using OpenCV
 
#### Objective:
The objective of the project is to identify objects on the ground within images of different rooms (kitchen, living room, and bedroom) of an apartment. 

#### Library Usage:
The project utilizes the Python libraries OpenCV for image processing and Numpy for handling numerical data.

#### Image Detection Techniques:
Various techniques employed for image detection include grayscale conversion, application of a binary mask, contour detection, and the use of bounding boxes.

#### Algorithm Performance:
The developed algorithm showed promising results, successfully identifying objects on the ground. However, it struggled with images under inadequate lighting conditions or where the camera angle was drastically changed.

#### Potential Application:
This project has the potential to be improved and implemented in smart homes for the elderly to detect changes in their living environments, aiding in accident prevention and home safety.
