# Object Detection using OpenCV
 
Summary:

**Library Usage:**
The project utilizes the Python libraries OpenCV for image processing and Numpy for handling numerical data.

**Image Detection Techniques:**
Various techniques employed for image detection include grayscale conversion, application of a binary mask, contour detection, and the use of bounding boxes.

**Algorithm Performance:**
The developed algorithm showed promising results, successfully identifying objects on the ground. However, it struggled with images under inadequate lighting conditions or where the camera angle was drastically changed.

**Potential Application:**
This project has the potential to be improved and implemented in smart homes for the elderly to detect changes in their living environments, aiding in accident prevention and home safety.

**Script usage mode:**
The final Python script run.py takes as arguments the address of a folder containing images and a reference image. For example, the Image folder or the Image\Cuisine folder could be passed as arguments.
Example usage: python .\run.py ".\Images\"
